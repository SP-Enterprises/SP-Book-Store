								qualitative attributes. Their work has been pivotal in us being able to deploy new

						<p class="m-n"><em>"SP Book Stores has helped our web presence growth immensely. It will take a little
								bit of time to learn what information you need to supply them with to get the proper
								results that you want. But once you have a good working relationship with the team
								you're assigned, things go very smooth.

								Generally, I will email over a spreadsheet with part numbers, pricing, weights, and
								categories and then give them the link to the manufacturer's website for photos,
								descriptions, etc. and they will do 50-70 products per day (night time for us). In the
								beginning, you may want to do an example product first so that they see how you would
								like this information to look, especially if you have different attributes such as size,
								color, etc.

								Honestly, our business wouldn't be where it is today with out SP Book Stores India."</em>
